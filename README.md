# data-analysis
This repository includes my data analysis project "English Premier League 21/22". I have used a dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xibilolu/epl21 . I only used up until the column : shtont, as this project is a bigger-level one and my first in the field of data analysis. I cleaned and organized the data, added extra columns, and then analyzed some interesting data. I also included ML Model, such as linear regression.
