# The English Premier League 21/22 Data Analysis Project 
This repository includes my data analysis project "English Premier League 21/22". I have used a dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xibilolu/epl21 . I only used up until the column : shtont, as this project is a beginner-level project and my first in the field of data analysis. I cleaned and organized the data, added extra columns with insightful information, and then analyzed some interesting data. 
ML models such as linear regression were added.

## Content
In this project, I uncovered some interesting facts about the premier league. Who was the top scorer? Which countries were represented the most? How does the shots vs shots on target compare? Will the next penalty in the premier league be scored or missed? These are all questions answered in my project.
